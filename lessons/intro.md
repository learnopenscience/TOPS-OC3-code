# TOPS Core Curriculum Module 1: Ethos of Open Science

Have you ever marveled at mesmerizing scientific visualizations and wondered 
how they were generated and whether you can recreate them or maybe tweak 
them to produce new results? These types of images have been created by 
researchers using **research software**. These software products and sometimes 
their **source codes** are freely available to the public. 
Reproducing such results and using them to advance the knowledge 
produced by software products are among the pillars of open science. 
For example, Figure 1, is generated using E3SM, an Earth System model, 
the source code of which is available on GitHub.

Now, let’s say that you are intrigued by the idea of recreating Figure 1 
and tweaking the E3SM’s source code. We should start with obtaining the 
source code. Someone might ask since this project already has a fancy 
website why is the source code on GitHub? Let’s assume that we successfully 
got the source code and want to start recreating the figure. 
Naturally, the next question is how do we install it since there is no 
executable file in the source code? Maybe you are used to installing software 
packages using installation wizards, or maybe you are comfortable with 
working from command line. Which one is possible or preferable for installing 
this software? The next step after installation is running the software 
and visualizing the results. So, the question is, for generating the desired 
outputs, how do we configure the software, what are the required input data,
and how do we get them? Let’s take it a step further and say that you have 
some brilliant new ideas and want to implement in the source code, analyze 
the outputs, publish the results, and make your code publicly available. 
Therefore, the questions become: How do we facilitate navigating this 
seemingly complicated source code? After making modifications, are we allowed 
to share and republish the modified source code, and if so, how do go 
about it? How do we ensure that the republished code is findable and other 
researchers can reuse and build upon it?

The purpose of this module is to answer these questions, provide guidance 
for streamlining the workflow and ensuring that we give/get proper credits, 
and last but not least, draw your attention to and promote the importance 
of contributing and giving back to the Open Science community.
